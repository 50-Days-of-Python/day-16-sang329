# Day-16
   
Write a function called **sum_list** with one parameter that takes a **nested list** of integers as an argument and returns the sum of the integers. 
For example, if you pass **[[2, 4, 5, 6], [2, 3, 5, 6]]**
as an argument your function should return a sum of **33**.

**Tests** | **1** | **2** | **3**
--- | --- | --- | --- 
**Input:** | `[[21, 2, 13], [14, 51, 6], [27, 81, 9]]` | `[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]]` | `[[1, 2, 3, ], [ 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]]` 
**Output:** | `224` | `120` | `210`
